# CSnake

## Introduction
This is a simple Snake game written in C. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and trying to avoid running into walls or its own body. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by eating food and growing in size.

## How to play
Use WASD keys to control the direction of the snake. The snake will move in the direction of the arrow key that you press. Try to guide the snake to the food without running into any walls or the snake's body. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow in size and the player will earn a point.

## Game Over
If the snake runs into a wall or its own body, the game will be over. The player's final score will be displayed on the screen.

## Good luck!
I hope you have fun playing the Snake game.
